# university-london-p5.js

This repository contains scripts that I have created while passing the course
'Introduction to Computer Programming' of University of London. Scripts are
built using Java Script library p5.js.

Dictionaries 'week1' and 'week2' contain scripts created following instructions
while directory 'assignment' contain scripts built to perform tasks for assignments.

This is not for use of another learners but instead to demonstrate my skills
obtained on this course.
